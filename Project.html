        <h2>Question No: 2 </h2>
         
        Problem Statement 
        Because of the growing health problems in today's world. An increasingly stressful lifestyle is detrimental
         to public health. With the increase in lines
         in hospitals and the ever-increasing number of patients, doctors' fees have skyrocketed, especially for 
         those patients who are unable to afford these services or who do not suffer from serious illness. Now-a-days
          everyone's life is smart because of using the internet. Our problem is developing a Web application that 
          provides all the necessary information related to health issues and provides a doctor who can help patients 
          treat themselves.                                                            
        
        <h2>Question No: 3 </h2>
         
        Abstract              
        Healthcare management system is an online communication between a doctor and a patient. This app is useful for patients to ask questions and express their 
        concerns to doctors about their health status. This app will help patients to consult a doctor without making physical appointments. In addition, using 
        this application the patient can make an appointment with the doctor at the clinic / hospital. Similarly, this app benefits physicians by providing the 
        following functionality:  Unlike other similar kinds of systems available. The best deal he deserves. Healthcare organizations are undergoing major 
        reorganizations and adjustments to meet the increasin demands of improved healthcare access and quality, as well as lowered costs. As the use of information 
        technology to process medical data increases, much of the critical information necessary to meet these challenges is being stored in digital format. Webenabled 
        information technologies can provide the means for greater access and more effective integration of healthcare information from disparate computer applications 
        and other information resources. In this chapter, various examples of web-based applications in healthcare area have been described and the core benefits of 
        the web-based applications have been presented. 
      
        <h2>Project Idea</h2> 
        • To develop a system that allows the user to have control over their appointment making service • To facilitate 
        the patients and easy for the patients and Doctors • To maximize operation hours • To reduce the inconvenience 
        and safe time for users 
        • To make the user online platform for their consultation 
        • To provide convenience for consultancy at home 
        • To view Doctor list 
        
         <h2>Project Scope </h2>
         • The Web application provides functions and features for a patient to get help from doctors. • We have three 
         users in it which are Patient, Doctor and Pharmacy. • Patient can ask any health issue, take appointment, upload 
         lab test reports and also get health product. • The concerned doctor will update the information about their 
         services and this information will be presented to the patient of University. 
         
        <h2>Proposed Solution </h2>              
        The Web application will involve Three different users who will be working together to provide better health care 
        services through consultation and consultation with a specialist. The patient will see a doctor at any time by 
        staying in his home. The interaction exists because the user will have the option of sending the data for analysis 
        to the receiving physician and acting on his advice. The patient and the Doctor will also communicate. Any Patient 
        can ask a question freely and any doctor will answer it medically.
